# Git Apple 🍏

Bad apple, but as a GitHub contributions graph.

Check it out [LIVE 🔴](https://lnus.github.io/git-apple/)!

## How does it work?

It reads the frame data from the video, using `generate.py` to convert the frames into arrays of `0` or `1`.
After this, the `script.js` reads these frames and colors the frames accordingly.

Pretty neat!

## Disclaimer about the code standard

The code is a bit hacky since I wrote the code in 4 hours while drinking with a friend.

But hey, *it works*!
